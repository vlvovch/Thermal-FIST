## [Version 1.5]

Date: 2024-03-22

Version 1.5 contains a number of new features and improvements.

## Real gas HRG

This version contains a first complete version of real gas HRG.
Real gas is a generalization of the van der Waals HRG.
It implements a generalization of the excluded volume prescription by considering non-linear EV prescriptions, such as [Carnahan-Starling EoS](http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Carnahan-Starling_equation_of_state).
It also allows one to incorporate arbitrary mean fields which can be a function of all densities in the system.
This allows one to model the effects of interactions in dense regime, such as in neutron stars.

A real gas model for a single component case has been formulated in [Vovchenko, Phys. Rev. C 96, 015206 (2017)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1510282) while a paper detailing the formulation of the model for multiple components is in preparation.

Real gas HRG is implemented as a new [**ThermalModelRealGas**](include/HRGRealGas/ThermalModelRealGas.h) class.
It takes as input the [excluded volume model](include/HRGRealGas/ExcludedVolumeModelsMulti.h) and the [mean field model](include/HRGRealGas/MeanFieldModelsMulti.h), both of which can be arbitrary.
The source code contains a number of examples of both models, such as van der Waals/Carnahan-Starling excluded volume, and van der Waals or baryon density dependent mean field.

Real gas HRG fully supports the calculation of all the standard thermodynamic quantities and susceptibilities and has the complete functionality of van der Waals HRG model from before.

See examples [ThermodynamicsBQS.cpp](https://vovchenko.net/project/thermal-fist/doc/_thermodynamics_b_q_s_8cpp-example.html) and [SusceptibilitiesBQS.cpp](https://vovchenko.net/project/thermal-fist/doc/_susceptibilities_b_q_s_8cpp-example.html) which include Real Gas HRG option and [this link](https://vovchenko.net/project/thermal-fist/doc/classthermalfist_1_1_thermal_model_real_gas.html) for documentation.

Version 1.3 contains a number of new features, improvements, and bugfixes

## Partial chemical equilibrium (PCE)

This release implements HRG in partial chemical equilibrium (PCE) [Bebie et al, [Nucl. Phys. B **378**, 95 (1992)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/316591)], as appropriate for modeling the hadronic phase of heavy-ion collisions. PCE is implemented as a new **ThermalModelPCE** class, and has been used in two recent papers, [Phys. Lett. B **800**, 135131 (2020)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1726464) and [Phys. Rev. C **102**, 024909 (2020)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1751960)

See [PCE-Saha-LHC.cpp](./src/examples/PCE/PCE-Saha-LHC.cpp) for a usage example and [this link](https://vovchenko.net/project/thermal-fist/doc/classthermalfist_1_1_thermal_model_p_c_e.html) for documentation.

The PCE-HRG model is available in the thermal fitting routine, with Tkin being an extra fitting parameter

The PCE-HRG is also accessible for use in the graphical user interface program through a button `PCE/Saha/Other...`

## Particle lists

- The default particle list is now based on the 2020 edition of the PDG listing. As before, the list contains only hadrons and resonances with an established status. Changes compared to the old 2014 PDG list are mild.

- Version 1.3 now fully supports charm. The charmed hadrons are available in an extended input list file [list-withcharm.dat](./input/list/PDG2020/list-withcharm.dat)

- The excited nuclei with mass number up to A = 5 have been added with this release, they are available in an extended input list file [list-withexcitednuclei.dat](./input/list/PDG2020/list-withexcitednuclei.dat). The reference for this list of excited nuclei is [Phys. Lett. B **809**, 135746 (2020)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1790683)

- The hadron list converted from [SMASH](https://smash-transport.github.io/) transport model (version 1.8) is available [here](./input/list/SMASH-1.8)
