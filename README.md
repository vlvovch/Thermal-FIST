**Thermal-FIST** (or simply **The FIST**) is a C++ package designed for a convenient general-purpose analysis within the family of hadron resonance gas (HRG) models.
This mainly includes statistical analysis of particle production in heavy-ion collisions and phenomenology of the equation of state of hadronic matter.

### Main Features
- HRG equation of state and related properties
  - Thermodynamics
  - Susceptibilities
  - Speed of sound and heat capacity
  - Hadron yields
  - Fluctuations and correlations
  - Statisical ensembles
    - Grand-canonical
    - Canonical
    - Mixed-canonical

- Extensions of the standard (ideal) HRG model
  - Finite resonance widths
  - Repulsive interactions
    - van der Waals
    - Generalized excluded volume (Carnahan-Starling etc.)
    - Multi-component
  - Mean-field interactions
    - van der Waals and beyond
    - vector density functional
  - Partial chemical equilibrium
  - Fluctuations and correlations of both conserved (charges) and non-conserved (hadron numbers) quantities

- Heavy-ion applications
  - Thermal fits
  - Small systems and canonical effects
  - Light nuclei
  - Chemical non-equilibrium
  - Partial chemical equilibrium
    - Saha equation for light nuclei
    - Baryon annihilation
  - Monte Carlo event generator
    - Blast-Wave, Cracow, Siemens-Rasmussen models
    - Based on hydrodynamics hypersurface
    - Canonical ensemble and hard-core repulsion

- Other applications
  - Neutron star matter equation of state
  - Early Universe (cosmic trajectories)

- Graphical User Interface (QtThermalFIST)

### QtThermalFIST

The package includes **QtThermalFIST** -- a Qt-based graphical user interface frontend designed for a fast and convenient general-purpose thermal model analysis. Typical tasks, such as calculating
the equation of state properties or performing the thermal fits,
can be done in GUI. Using the GUI can therefore be a good starting point.

### Usage

Thermal-FIST is a C++ package, and can be used in C++ code. Common usage patters include:

- C++ macro using linking to the Thermal-FIST library. See [src/examples](src/examples) for illustration.
- As a submodule. See [https://github.com/vlvovch/finite-resonance-widths](https://github.com/vlvovch/finite-resonance-widths) for an example.
- As an event generator. See [https://github.com/vlvovch/fist-sampler](https://github.com/vlvovch/fist-sampler) for an example.
- Using graphical user interface.
- As a Jupyter notebook. See [https://github.com/vlvovch/fist-jupyter](https://github.com/vlvovch/fist-jupyter) for an example. (NOTE: does not work on Apple Silicon)


Please see the [**Quick Start Guide**](docs/quickstart.md) to get started as well as [the examples](https://vovchenko.net/project/thermal-fist/doc/examples.html) in [src/examples](src/examples) for illustration.

For running Thermal-FIST in the cloud, you may use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). It may even possible to run the GUI from a browser, see [https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite)

### Documentation

Please see the [**Thermal-FIST documentation**](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/~vovchenko/project/thermal-fist/doc/)

### Notes

- It is recommended to use the latest version of the package. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
- Undocumented new features and bugfixes often first appear in the [devel branch](https://github.com/vlvovch/Thermal-FIST/tree/devel)
- Open an issue if you have possible improvements/new features/bugfixes in mind
- Calculations may break down for excessive/overstressed parameters.
This should be carefully monitored, and the accuracy of the output assessed.
If in doubt, contact the program author(s).
